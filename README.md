# The incredible story of Tui

(Ceci est une update à cause de problèmes sur le main del'ancienne version)

Tui was a **very small** man. He was almost 27 cm tall, about the height of 3 apples. Due to his **very short** stature Tui encountered many problems in her daily life. Suffice to say that sitting on a bar stool to flirt was not an easy task.

Under the mentorship of the wise seagull, Tui embarked on a journey of self-discovery. Together, they practiced the art of smooth conversation and confident wing flutters. Tui learned to embrace his uniqueness and charm potential mates with his witty banter and genuine compliments.
